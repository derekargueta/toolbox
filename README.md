Sometimes can't remember what's all in my toolbox ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ These are CLI tools - not libraries or services. (although some tools are implemented as libraries I guess...)
Making this repo because my stars get cluttered with tools, services, libraries, compilers, interpreters, code-I-just-wanna-read, projects-that-I-wanna-contribute-to.
This is the lazy way of cleaning out the closet.

The idea behind this is before starting any project, I can come here and decide at the beginning of the projects which tools I'd like to incorporate to improve developer productivity from the get-go.
